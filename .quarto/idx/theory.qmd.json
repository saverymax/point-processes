Given an area or quadrat called subregion $A$ of $D$ of size $|A|$ centered around site $s_i$ we can model the number of individuals occurring at that site $N_{s}(A)$ with a poisson distribution. This distribution will have mean \n$$\n\\Lambda(A) = \\int\\lambda(s)ds\n$$ \nFor the demonstration here, we assume $|A|=1$. However, the parameters in the Poisson Point Process are invariant to the scale of the data.\n\nTypically, we model the intensity with a log-linear function, for example with parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$,\n$$\n\\lambda(s) = \\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x(s)]\n$$\nso that the expected number of observations in region A is now\n$$\n\\Lambda(A) = \\int_A\\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x(s)]ds\n$$\nWe quickly notice that this integral is intractable and we will need a method of numerical integration. Indeed this will be discussed and explored here.\n\nConsider, however, that we are going to be dealing with environmental data with environmental covariates, which are going to be discretized at some resolution inherently. Therefore, we can think of the inhomogenous poisson process as a continuous limit of a discretized set of conditionally independent poisson random variables, where the IPP emerges as the discretization grows smaller, i.e., $\\Lambda(ds), ds\\to 0$. In fact, using this continuous limit is how the likelihood for the PP can be derived (Banerjee, 2014. p203-4). However, considering that we will be working in a discretized space, the continuous framework ends up being less practically useful. \n\nWe now define the likelihood for the NHPP (Banerjee, 2014, p214)\n$$\nf(s_1, s_2...s_n|N(D)=n) = \\prod_i\\frac{\\lambda(s_i)}{(\\lambda(D))^n}\n$$\nand the joint density will be\n$$\nf(s_1, s_2...s_n,N(D)=n) = \\prod_i\\frac{\\lambda(s_i)}{(\\lambda(D))^n}\\left[(\\lambda(D))^n\\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda(D))}{n!}\\right]\n$$\nwhere we can see the second term on the right corresponds to the poisson likelihood for the number of total observations in space $D$.\nThe likelihood will then be\n$$\nL(\\lambda(s)|s_1, s_2,...,s_n) = \\prod_i\\lambda(s_i)\\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda(D))}{n!}\n$$\nWe can move between the continuous and discrete versions of this likelihood by partitioning $D$ into a grid of $c$ cells and taking the poisson likelihood\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:pp-l}\nL(\\lambda) = \\prod_c(\\lambda(A_c))^{N(A_c)}\\exp(-\\lambda(A_c))\n\\end{equation}\nNoticing that we can sum all the exponents, we get\n$$\nL(\\lambda) = \\prod_c(\\lambda(A_c))^{N(A_c)}\\exp(-[\\lambda(A_1) + \\lambda(A_2) + \\cdots+\\lambda(A_c)) = \\prod_c(\\lambda(A_c))^{N(A_c)}\\exp(-\\lambda(D)]\n$$\nand $N(A_c) = 1/0, |A_c|\\to 0$. The term on the right indeed reduces to \\ref{eq:pp-l}. We can then safely work with the Poisson likelihood given our grid is fine enough. This will be explored later.\n\nWe still have, however, one issue. We originally defined the mean of the of region $A$ according to the properties of the PP,\n$$\n\\Lambda(A) = \\int_A\\lambda(s)ds= \\int_A\\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x(s)]ds\n$$\nSuddenly we are saying that we can just work with the intensity for region $A$ without clarifying what we should do about the integral over the functional for intensity. Unfortunately, while we may want the integral over $s$, we don't have information at the resolution of $ds$. All we have are covariates $\\beta'X$. That is,\n$$\n\\int_A\\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x(s)]ds \\approx |A|\\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x]\n$$\nNotice that we no longer have $x(s)$. We assume the covariate information is relative constant over region $A$. If this doesn't hold, our approximation will not be correct. But, given that it is all the information we have, the assumption is built into any modelling procedure and is less an issue with the Poisson Process and more just an issue of covariate resolution which is a common modelling issue in spatial-temporal statistics. As is stated in Banerjee, 2014 (p216) \"In the absence of finer covariate resolution, we cannot do better with regard to the ecological fallacy.\"\n\nAlso, originally, we mentioned that it is convenient to assume $|A| = 1$. This is now the reason, so we don't have to worry about the scaling factor.\n\nGiven this approximation and scaling assumption, we now have\n$$\n\\Lambda(A) = \\int_A\\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x(s)]ds \\approx |A|\\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x] = \\frac{|D|}{c}\\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x]\n$$\nwhere $c$ is the number of cells and $|D|$ is our total area. Then the counts in subregion $A$ will be distributed as\n$$\nN(A_i) \\sim Poisson\\left(\\frac{|D|}{c}\\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x_i]\\right) = Poisson\\left(\\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x_i]\\right) \n$$\nif the number of cells is equal to the area $(|A| = 1)$. Based on this, we end up with the log-likelihood for our entire presence-only dataset:\n$$\nl(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\sum_{i\\in B}N(A_i)(\\alpha + \\beta'x_i) - \\frac{|D|}{c}\\sum_{i\\in B}\\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x_i] - \\sum_{i\\in B}\\log(N(A_i))!\n$$\nwhere $i\\in B$ refers to the set of background points $B={1,2,...,c}$. We take this likelihood over the entire set of background points in order to appropriately estimate the integral\n$$\n\\Lambda(D) = \\int_D\\lambda(s)ds\n$$\nWe need all points in the grid to approximate the integral, as is clear in the original likelihood. Thus, we have defined our model and the likelihood that we can use for PO data."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"theory.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","bibliography":["references.bib"],"theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
