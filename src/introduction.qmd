# Introduction

In this document we discuss models for presence-only data, using Thinned Nonhomogenous Poisson Processes and Log Gaussian Cox Processes. The initial planned layout is as follows: Introduce Poisson Process models and the data generating process. Then, proceed to fit a Thinned Nonhomogenous Poisson Process in Stan (and in spatstat), on simulated presence-only data. 

The rest of this document implements the above description, including theory where necessary.
