    "text": "The poisson process describes a set of points \\(S\\) where \\(\\{s_i\\} \\subseteq D\\) with intensity \\(\\lambda\\). Given an area or quadrat called subregion \\(A\\) of \\(D\\) of size \\(|A|\\) centered around site \\(s_i\\) we can model the number of individuals occurring at that site \\(N_{s}(A)\\) with a poisson distribution. This distribution will have mean \\[\n\\Lambda(A) = \\int\\lambda(s)ds\n\\] For the demonstration here, we assume \\(|A|=1\\). However, the parameters in the Poisson Point Process are invariant to the scale of the data.\nTypically, we model the intensity with a log-linear function, for example with parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\), \\[\n\\lambda(s) = \\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x(s)]\n\\] so that the expected number of observations in region A is now \\[\n\\Lambda(A) = \\int_A\\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x(s)]ds\n\\] We quickly notice that this integral is intractable and we will need a method of numerical integration. Indeed this will be discussed and explored here.\nConsider, however, that we are going to be dealing with environmental data with environmental covariates, which are going to be discretized at some resolution inherently. Therefore, we can think of the inhomogenous poisson process as a continuous limit of a discretized set of conditionally independent poisson random variables, where the IPP emerges as the discretization grows smaller, i.e., \\(\\Lambda(ds), ds\\to 0\\). In fact, using this continuous limit is how the likelihood for the PP can be derived (Banerjee, 2014. p203-4). However, considering that we will be working in a discretized space, the continuous framework ends up being less practically useful.\nWe now define the likelihood for the NHPP (Banerjee, 2014, p214) \\[\nf(s_1, s_2...s_n|N(D)=n) = \\prod_i\\frac{\\lambda(s_i)}{(\\lambda(D))^n}\n\\] and the joint density will be \\[\nf(s_1, s_2...s_n,N(D)=n) = \\prod_i\\frac{\\lambda(s_i)}{(\\lambda(D))^n}\\left[(\\lambda(D))^n\\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda(D))}{n!}\\right]\n\\] where we can see the second term on the right corresponds to the poisson likelihood for the number of total observations in space \\(D\\). The likelihood will then be \\[\nL(\\lambda(s)|s_1, s_2,...,s_n) = \\prod_i\\lambda(s_i)\\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda(D))}{n!}\n\\] We can move between the continuous and discrete versions of this likelihood by partitioning \\(D\\) into a grid of \\(c\\) cells and taking the poisson likelihood \\[\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:pp-l}\nL(\\lambda) = \\prod_c(\\lambda(A_c))^{N(A_c)}\\exp(-\\lambda(A_c))\n\\end{equation}\\] Noticing that we can sum all the exponents, we get \\[\nL(\\lambda) = \\prod_c(\\lambda(A_c))^{N(A_c)}\\exp(-[\\lambda(A_1) + \\lambda(A_2) + \\cdots+\\lambda(A_c)) = \\prod_c(\\lambda(A_c))^{N(A_c)}\\exp(-\\lambda(D)]\n\\] and \\(N(A_c) = 1/0, |A_c|\\to 0\\). The term on the right indeed reduces to \\(\\ref{eq:pp-l}\\). We can then safely work with the Poisson likelihood given our grid is fine enough. This will be explored later.\nWe still have, however, one issue. We originally defined the mean of the of region \\(A\\) according to the properties of the PP, \\[\n\\Lambda(A) = \\int_A\\lambda(s)ds= \\int_A\\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x(s)]ds\n\\] Suddenly we are saying that we can just work with the intensity for region \\(A\\) without clarifying what we should do about the integral over the functional for intensity. Unfortunately, while we may want the integral over \\(s\\), we don’t have information at the resolution of \\(ds\\). All we have are covariates \\(\\beta'X\\). That is, \\[\n\\int_A\\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x(s)]ds \\approx |A|\\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x]\n\\] Notice that we no longer have \\(x(s)\\). We assume the covariate information is relative constant over region \\(A\\). If this doesn’t hold, our approximation will not be correct. But, given that it is all the information we have, the assumption is built into any modelling procedure and is less an issue with the Poisson Process and more just an issue of covariate resolution which is a common modelling issue in spatial-temporal statistics. As is stated in Banerjee, 2014 (p216) “In the absence of finer covariate resolution, we cannot do better with regard to the ecological fallacy.”\nAlso, originally, we mentioned that it is convenient to assume \\(|A| = 1\\). This is now the reason, so we don’t have to worry about the scaling factor.\nGiven this approximation and scaling assumption, we now have \\[\n\\Lambda(A) = \\int_A\\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x(s)]ds \\approx |A|\\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x] = \\frac{|D|}{c}\\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x]\n\\] where \\(c\\) is the number of cells and \\(|D|\\) is our total area. Then the counts in subregion \\(A\\) will be distributed as \\[\nN(A_i) \\sim Poisson\\left(\\frac{|D|}{c}\\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x_i]\\right) = Poisson\\left(\\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x_i]\\right)\n\\] if the number of cells is equal to the area \\((|A| = 1)\\). Based on this, we end up with the log-likelihood for our entire presence-only dataset: \\[\nl(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\sum_{i\\in B}N(A_i)(\\alpha + \\beta'x_i) - \\frac{|D|}{c}\\sum_{i\\in B}\\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x_i] - \\sum_{i\\in B}\\log(N(A_i))!\n\\] where \\(i\\in B\\) refers to the set of background points \\(B={1,2,...,c}\\). We take this likelihood over the entire set of background points in order to appropriately estimate the integral \\[\n\\Lambda(D) = \\int_D\\lambda(s)ds\n\\] We need all points in the grid to approximate the integral, as is clear in the original likelihood. Thus, we have defined our model and the likelihood that we can use for PO data.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Having introduced some theory for Poisson Point Process models, we next move on to data simulation. Here we simulate some presence-only data, in preparation to fit a nonhomogenous poisson process model. We specify the intensity for each site, the total number of individuals, the area of each site (assumed to be 1 here), and the sampling bias.\nFollowing Fithian 2015, each observation \\(i\\) is associated with a site \\(s_i\\) area \\(D\\). For each site \\(s_i\\), there are associated covariates \\(x_i = x(s_i)\\) and \\(z_i = z(s_i)\\). For each survey site, \\(s_i\\) represents the centroid of a quadrat Ai. This is an essential assumption in our model, where we will use the Poisson likelihood to for the number of counts in each quadrat. At \\(s_i\\) we observe counts \\(N_{i} = N_{}(A_i)\\) or binary presence/absence indicators \\(y_{i}\\), with \\(y_{i} = 1\\) if \\(N_i &gt; 0\\) and \\(y_i = 0\\) otherwise.\nOne issue in generating the data is that in using a poisson model to simulate the counts for each site, we lose individual point information in aggregating the points to counts per quadrat. However, this issue of aggregation is unavoidable, because we are using covariates that correspond to each cell. This is an important point. The assumptions we make about the grid will actually effect the way we simulate data. For example, when the only covariate data we have is that which is associated with the quadrat we are working with, then to simulate the data, each point realization will be created in aggregate, that is, a draw from a poisson distribution characterized by an functional of intensity dependent only on the covariates.\nIf our covariates exist on a finer scale than the quadrat, we can simulate the point locations more finely as well, and take a simulation approach outlined on page 2020 of Banerjee 2014 and followed by Koshkina, 2017. In this approach, we simulate first the total number of observations, create a homogenous poisson process, and then thin the process at the level of the grid of covariates we are working with. It doesn’t completely make sense to simulate PPP data in this way here, because our covariates only exist at the level of the aggregated quadrat. That is, we assume that the intensity is constant across our region \\(A\\), because according to our true data generating process, it is. This is also convenient for the approximation we are using.\nWe must also take into account the bias associated with the observation of species with true intensity \\(\\lambda(s)\\). In order to account for the bias caused by collecting presence-only observations, the poisson process is thinned by the sampling bias \\(b\\). For more information about thinning a poisson process, see https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/580883/thinning-a-poisson-process \\[\n\\lambda(s) = \\theta(s)b(s) = \\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x(s) + \\gamma + \\delta'z(s)].\n\\] The question of the data generating process under our modelling assumptions is an interesting one. Referencing our initial theoretical outline, we need to simulate points with likelihood \\[\n\\prod_i\\lambda(s_i)\\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda(D))}{n!}.\n\\] In the homogenous case, we can simulate \\(n\\) observations from \\[\nN(D) \\sim Poisson(\\lambda|D|),\n\\] (\\(\\lambda(s)=\\lambda\\), and is thus constant over \\(D\\)), and then according to the \\(n\\), distribute these uniformly over \\(D\\). In the case of the Nonhomogenous Poisson Process, we can do the same, drawing \\(n\\) now from \\(N(D) \\sim Poisson(\\lambda(D)) = Poisson(\\int_D\\lambda(s)ds)\\), and then distributing their locations over \\(D\\). Instead of uniformly distributing them however, they are placed according to the distribution \\(\\frac{\\lambda(s)}{\\lambda(D)}\\). There are two issues here, both relating to the evaluation of the integral for the expected number of observations.\nRemember that we are using as intensity \\[\n\\lambda(A_i) = \\int_A\\lambda(s)ds = \\int_A\\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x(s)]ds = \\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x_i],\n\\] because we only have information \\(X_i\\) for quadrat \\(A_i\\) centered around \\(s_i\\). While we are doing simulations, we could arbitrarily create a finer covariate grid but we won’t have access to this during the modelling process. Using the \\(x_i\\) we have, both \\(\\lambda(A)\\) and \\(\\lambda(D)\\) will be approximations at the covariate resolution, using the assumption that each \\(x_i\\) is constant over \\(A_i\\). This being the case, then for each observation, we will use the same distribution as the other points that fall into the same \\(A_i\\). That is, multiple points will have the same distribution \\(\\frac{\\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x_i]}{\\sum_i \\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x_i]}\\). This goes somewhat against the idea of distributing the points in continuous space. Therefore, given the independence of each \\(A_i\\) conditional on the covariates, another approach is to generate counts for each \\(A_i\\) and then uniformly distribute them within each \\(A_i\\). If \\(x_i\\) is constant across \\(A_i\\), this is ok. However, if we cannot assume this, using the continuous probability distribution for each point \\((\\lambda(s)/\\lambda(D))\\) is necessary to avoid the integral of \\(\\lambda(A)\\). We can do so in a way that avoids computing \\(\\lambda(D)\\) as well (Banerjee, 2014. p220), by computing \\(\\lambda_{max}\\), simulating \\(n\\) from \\(N(D) \\sim Poisson(\\lambda_{max}|D|)\\), and the rejecting some of these points by \\(\\lambda(s_i)/\\lambda_{max}\\). In this way, the only thing we need is information at the level of \\(\\lambda(s_i\\)) and avoid \\(\\lambda(D)\\) and \\(\\lambda(A)\\).\nSo note that we take the route of simulation depending on our available information. If we only have \\(x_i\\) for each quadrat, directly generating the points as a poisson random variable is a good option because it avoids any complicated integrals. But if we have finer covariates than at the quadrat level we are working with, then thinning the process down with the approach of Banerjee and others is better because it also avoids the integrals and has finer resolution.\nThere are a few things be aware of during the data gerating process with the NHPP. The area of the total space, \\(|D|\\), the area of each site (quadrat) \\(|A_i|\\), and the number of cells \\(c\\) that \\(D\\) is discretized into. The area of \\(A\\) depends on the number of discretizations (or cells): \\(|A_i| = |D|/c\\). The intensity will be scaled by this factor \\(|D|/c\\), so that as the area of \\(|A|\\) becomes smaller, the intensity converges to that of a “true” continuous poisson process with its center at \\(A_i\\). We also assume that the intensity is constant over \\(A\\), so that we can indeed scale the intensity by the area factor, instead of needing to integrate over \\(A\\). This assumption is in contrast to assuming that we model the instensity directly as \\(\\Lambda(A_i) = \\exp(\\beta'X)\\) (versus \\(\\Lambda(A_i) = \\frac{|D|}{c}\\exp(\\beta'X)\\)).",

This is made using the assumption that the counts at sites \\(s_i\\) are distributed following a poisson process with mean \\(\\lambda\\). This assumption allows for a simpler specification of the likelihood, since we can use the poisson distribution. The setting of \\(|A|=1\\) allows us to make this assumption, as we do not need to multiple the intensity parameter \\(\\lambda\\) by the area in the model.\nThe next sections of code fitting and diagnosing the poisson process model in Stan, using the generated data.\nmodel_string &lt;- stan_poisson_process\nwrite(model_string, model_path)\n# data_reps is 1 here so just use the first index\ndata = list(N = sites, X = grid_points$aux_x, Z = grid_points$aux_z, y = sim_data$Y[data_reps,])\nmodel &lt;- cmdstan_model(model_path)\nfit &lt;- model$sample(data=data, seed=13, chains=3, iter_sampling=2000, iter_warmup=200)\nThe above code fits the table.

In the above plots, we can notice that the bias and (unthinned) intensity are behaving strangely. Here we observe the effect of correlated parameters describing the behavior of the intensity and the bias the NHPP. We examine the distributions of the generated quantities using the fitted model.\nThe issue with the large values is both because we are taking the mean of the posterior distribution as our point estimate, and the high correlation between the two parameters causes the estimates to inversely fluctuate around each other.\n\nplot_title &lt;- ggtitle(paste(\"Posterior distributions, with means and 90% interval\"))\np_post &lt;- mcmc_intervals(fit$draws(),  prob = 0.9, point_est=\"mean\", regex_pars = generated_vars[1]) + plot_title\nprint(p_post)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np_post &lt;- mcmc_intervals(fit$draws(),  prob = 0.9, point_est=\"mean\", regex_pars = generated_vars[2]) + plot_title\nprint(p_post)\n\nWarning: Removed 57 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np_post &lt;- mcmc_intervals(fit$draws(),  prob = 0.9, point_est=\"mean\", regex_pars = generated_vars[3]) + plot_title\nprint(p_post)\n\nWarning: Removed 100 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Look at counts for each site\ngen_y &lt;- c(\"y_rep[1]\", \"y_rep[10]\", \"y_rep[20]\")\np_post &lt;- mcmc_hist(fit$draws(), pars=gen_y)\nprint(p_post)\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

This high skew is caused by the correlation between b and l, since these parameters are not estimable between themselves. Therefore, we arrive at reasonable estimates for b*l since this is draw specific (where when one is high the other is low), but the overall mean for either b or l over multiple draws cannot be trusted. This is clear from the histograms of \\(\\lambda\\) and the bias, where most of the values take on very low values, but do fluctuate higher. And when one goes higher, the other goes lower, which I’d like to check a specific example of, for one draw.\n\n# Nuts diagnostics that I haven't tried to understand really\nnuts_fit &lt;- nuts_params(fit)\nhead(nuts_fit)\n\n  Chain Iteration   Parameter Value\n1     1         1 treedepth__     5\n2     1         2 treedepth__     7\n3     1         3 treedepth__     2\n4     1         4 treedepth__     7\n5     1         5 treedepth__     6\n6     1         6 treedepth__     5\n\nmcmc_nuts_treedepth(nuts_fit, log_posterior(fit))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmcmc_nuts_acceptance(nuts_fit,  log_posterior(fit))\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

To do so, we fit a Log Gaussian Cox Process (LGCP). Where before we specified the intensity as \\[\n\\lambda(s) = \\theta(s)b(s) = \\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x(s) + \\gamma + \\delta'z(s)]\n\\] we now add a Gaussian process to incorporate spatial correlation between sites \\[\n\\lambda(s) = \\theta(s)b(s) = \\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x(s) + \\gamma + \\delta'z(s) + w(s)]\n\\] so that the expected value for quadrat \\(A\\) will be the integral over the quadrat: \\[\n\\Delta(A) = \\int_A\\lambda(s)ds = \\int_A \\exp[\\alpha + \\beta'x(s) + \\gamma + \\delta'z(s) + w(s)]ds\n\\] We make the same approximations as before based on our limited covariate resolution.\nWhile the topic of LGCPs on its own is quite interesting and deserves its own treatment, for now we examine its behavior only as an adjustment to the NHPP. In a future post I will discuss approximations to the LGCP, which are quite important as fitting the spatial correlation matrix is computationally intensive and not practical if we will want to apply the LGCP to developing optimal designs.\nI proceed with the stan code.\n\nmodel_string &lt;- log_gaussian_cox_process\nwrite(model_string, model_path)\n# Here we need to use the distance matrix\ndata = list(N = sites, X = grid_points$aux_x, Z = grid_points$aux_z, y = sim_data$Y[data_reps,], D = distance_mat)\nmodel &lt;- cmdstan_model(model_path)\nlgcp_fit &lt;- model$sample(data=data, seed=13, chains=3, iter_sampling=2000, iter_warmup=200, thin = 10)\n\nHaving fit the LGCP we can examine the parameters. {r) #| label: lgcp-params #| eval: false lgcp_fit$summary(variables=c('alpha', 'beta', 'gamma', 'delta')) And then we look at the posterior diagnostics.\n\nposterior &lt;- lgcp_fit$draws()\ncolor_scheme_set(\"mix-blue-pink\")\np_trace &lt;- mcmc_trace(posterior,  pars = c(\"alpha\", \"beta\", \"gamma\", \"delta\"),\n                      facet_args = list(nrow = 2, labeller = label_parsed))\nprint(p_trace + facet_text(size = 15))\n\nplot_title &lt;- ggtitle(paste(\"Posterior distributions, with means and 90% interval\"))\np_post &lt;- mcmc_areas(posterior,  prob = 0.9, point_est=\"mean\", regex_pars = c(\"alpha\", \"beta\")) + plot_title\nprint(p_post)\n\nplot_title &lt;- ggtitle(paste(\"Posterior distributions, with means and 90% interval\"))\np_post &lt;- mcmc_areas(posterior,  prob = 0.9, point_est=\"mean\", regex_pars = c(\"gamma\", \"delta\")) + plot_title\nprint(p_post)\n\nmcmc_intervals(posterior, pars=c('alpha', 'beta', 'gamma', 'delta'))\n#mcmc_hist(fit$draws(), pars = c('alpha', 'beta', 'gamma', 'delta')) \nplot_title &lt;- ggtitle(\"Parameter posterior sample correlation\")\np_post &lt;- mcmc_pairs(posterior, pars=c('alpha', 'beta', 'gamma', 'delta'))\nprint(p_post)\nmcmc_scatter(posterior, pars=c('alpha','gamma'))\n\nFinally look at the posterior predictions for \\(\\lambda\\), \\(b\\), and \\(\\lambda\\cdot b\\).\n\ngenerated_vars &lt;- c('lambda_bias', 'lambda_rep', 'b_rep', 'y_rep')\nlambda_thinned &lt;- lgcp_fit$summary(variables=generated_vars[1])$mean\nlambda_rep &lt;- lgcp_fit$summary(variables=generated_vars[2])$mean\nbias_rep &lt;- lgcp_fit$summary(variables=generated_vars[3])$mean\ny_ppd &lt;- lgcp_fit$summary(variables=generated_vars[4])$mean\nppd_df &lt;- data.frame(x=grid_points$x, y=grid_points$y, y_rep=y_ppd, lt=lambda_thinned, l=lambda_rep, b=bias_rep)\nhead(ppd_df)\n\nWe can then check the generated data:\n\np &lt;- ggplot(ppd_df, aes(x, y, fill=y_rep)) + \n    geom_tile() +\n    scale_fill_viridis(discrete=FALSE) +\n    ggtitle(\"PPD counts per site\")\nprint(p)\n\np &lt;- ggplot(ppd_df, aes(x, y, fill=lt)) + \n    geom_tile() +\n    scale_fill_viridis(discrete=FALSE) +\n    ggtitle(\"Thinned intensity per site\")\nprint(p)\n\np &lt;- ggplot(ppd_df, aes(x, y, fill=l)) + \n    geom_tile() +\n    scale_fill_viridis(discrete=FALSE) +\n    ggtitle(\"Intensity per site\")\nprint(p)\np &lt;- ggplot(ppd_df, aes(x, y, fill=b)) + \n    geom_tile() +\n    scale_fill_viridis(discrete=FALSE) +\n    ggtitle(\"Bias per site\")\nprint(p)",
